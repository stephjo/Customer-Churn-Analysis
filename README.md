Conclusion and Recommendations
Conclusions:

Employees are most likely to leave a company after one year of working there and this peaks again every year after that.
The top reason why people leave is salary. The highest churn rates appear in the middle range of salaries and churn rates are lowest in when the salaries high and low.
Years of Seniority is the second highest reason for employees quitting, this could point to the salaries and seniority being correlated.
Recommendations:

Companies should pay extra attention to employees after one year of working there, offering extra incentives at the end of one year.
The biggest incentive they could give is higher salary, which is shown to be the most important reason that people stay or leave.
Companies should create extra incentives for customer service employees that have the highest rate of churn
Aside from that, I hope you enjoy the notebook!
