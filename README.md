Conclusion

Expolratory Data Analysis was used to form assumptions regarding the features which have high impact on customers' churn behaviour.Logistic regression model helped us to predict if a client will leave or not and showed us which are the most important features.

Customers can be segmented based on predicted probabilities and customer worth into groups ,so that company can focus on each group by introducing different plans and discounts. This will help to leverage the business as well as the customer satisfaction.

Aside from that, I hope you enjoy the notebook!
